3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) <br>
In this web development, I felt the fast-paced of front-end development with the outcomes
that are user-driven and Offer real-time programming. But I’m pretty curious
about how to optimize loading webpage faster? Does the webpage also convert the
front-end high-level code like HTML and Javascript to assembly code and then
convert the assembly code to binary code? Since I think running the binary code
will greatly improve the loading speed. And I’m also curious about how do large
Web sites handle a load of millions of visitors simultaneously, especially
during some online shopping festivals, such as Black Friday? How do they handle
that with the reduced cost? And what to do if the website crashes or becomes
inaccessible when they experience large traffic?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
